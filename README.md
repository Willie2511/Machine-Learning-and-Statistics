# Assessment

This Repository consists of an exercises folder which I used while studying the weekly notes and practicing the exercises throughout the module. It is broken down into three notebooks covering three different topics, each of which use similar libraries for different tasks.

The Time Anamoly Detection folder consists of an example notebook where I run a keras example using the JNJ.csv file. The second notebook is a Time Anamoly Detection model using keras to analyse the Dow Jones market average tracker since the year 1980. Both csv files were downloaded from the Yahoo Finance website. The notebook uses techniques and libraries which were studied throughout the semester to split the data into training and testing. We then used the trained model to detect anomalies in the data, which return a boolean value in an 'anomaly' column in a data frame. Using a Sequential model and carefully selecting layers allowed for the creation of an effective model, and a great learning experience.

I used numerous online examples, articles and videos along with lecture notes and recordings to both learn and complete this project.
